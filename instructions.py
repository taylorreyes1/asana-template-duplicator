instructions = """ If you have an urgent concern, call your respective Job Search Mentor, either Marlene (408-839-0360), Margot (610-585-7688), Geoff (818-903-1913) or Zaina (434-221-6133).

1. CREATING COMPANIES AS TASKS
Add companies you plan to apply to or have applied to by hitting the "add task" button at the top of your "project" or by placing the cursor in the name of the section you want the company to go in and hitting "return/enter". 

2. NEW COMPANIES
Add new companies as leads. Use description area of the task for notes about the company/position and links to job descriptions.

3. TRACKING PROGRESS
As you move through stages with a company, move the company into the appropriate section. Make sure to distinguish between the "Scheduled" and "Completed" sections for interviews and challenges.

Please update progress at least daily in the comments section of each company's task.  

4. CONCLUDED CONVERSATIONS
If a company turns you down, check them off as complete and leave them in the section of your Asana that corresponds to how far you got in the interview process. Should you decide not to move forward with a company, move them into the graveyard section. 

In both cases, it is useful to record notes that could allow us to help diagnose problems and better target your search.

5. OFFERS
When you get an offer, please upload any details or written offers to your corresponding asana project and e-mail outcomes@hackreactor.com and let the team know the terms of your offer. Do not accept, decline, negotiate or make any commitments prior to notifying the Student Outcomes Team.

6. QUESTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS
Questions regarding hiring partners, connections with alums at companies, and about offers received should be directed to outcomes@hackreactor.com during the course of your search. Questions regarding the mechanics of your job search, issues you are having during or preparing for interviews, or general questions or concerns regarding your job search should also be directed to outcomes@hackreactor.com.

Summary skeleton:
## About Me
example:
"I am a full-stack JavaScript engineer with extensive experience building and architecting production applications in various of environments, frameworks and languages. My passion is to engineer usable, beautiful and scalable software."

## Recent Experience:
example:
"Most recently I've been consulting with a three person startup focused on creating a next generation incentive based sales compensation platform which solves the technical customization complexities incumbent products have been unable to solve for decades. With nothing more than crude wireframes and preliminary backend architecture, I drove the full-stack development of the product to beta stage completion in just under a month. The technologies used include Node.js, Restify, PostgreSQL, Docker and Ansible on the back-end, and React with Flux on the front-end."

example:
"Previously, I was engineering for a corporate training company called Xcelus. My coworker and I noticed some serious scaling issues with the company's previous implementation of their core product. We pitched and implemented a new cloud SaaS platform to the CEO that was scalable for the clients they were bringing on and that also saved $5,000 - $10,000 per client. The old platform was built in PHP and was a custom install for each client; which left the company (and me) managing over 50 databases. We engineered the platform usingJava Play Framework while leveraging AWS for deployment."

##What Iâ€™m Looking For Next
